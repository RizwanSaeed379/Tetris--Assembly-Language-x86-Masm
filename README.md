# Tetris--Assembly-Language-x86-Masm
This is a working console based Tetris game that is developed using Assembly language using MASM x64 Assembler. This was my semester project in my 3rd semester for the course of Computer Organization and Assembly Language. In this project, Zaki Haider, my group partner, played a vital role.
